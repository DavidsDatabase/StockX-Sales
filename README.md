# StockX Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

This project's objective is to provide insights on sneaker sales from numerous KPIs such as sneaker model, sneaker brand, and even sneaker sizes. We are also diving down to analyze which states generated the most sales and profit across the United States. By analyzing these KPIs from the dataset, we look to identify any trends, make data-driven recommendations, and hopefully gauge on the sneaker's profitable margins.

### About the Data

The primary dataset can be found on <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hudsonstuck/stockx-data-contest/data>. The csv file is "StockX-Data-Contest-2019-3.csv". This dataset contains information regarding sneaker models, their prices sold at, retail prices, and much more.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to answer key questions, such as, but not limited to:

1. Which sneaker brand generated the most sales?
2. Which sneaker model generated the most sales? average sales?
3. Which sneaker model had the most buyers?
4. Which sneaker model generated the most profits?
5. Which state sold the most sneakers and generated the most sales?
6. What sneaker sizes had the most demand?
   
### Results/Findings

1. Adidas Yeezy had the most sales being $20,621,700, comparing to Off-White $15,759,337. 
2. The Adidas-Yeezy-Boost-350-V2-Beluga-2pt0 model generated the most sales being $4,021,336, which was fairly impressive as each pair costed $220. Another yeezy model, adidas-Yeezy-Boost-350-V2-Static-Reflective, had the highest average sale price of $2000.
3. The adidas-Yeezy-Boost-350-V2-Butter had the most pairs sold, which could mean the demand for this sneaker was high.
4. The Air-Jordan-1-Retro-High-Off-White-University-Blue sneaker generated the most profits, being $2,849,669 total. This was outstanding as there were only 4,329 pairs of these sneakers. Demand was high vs. the low supply.
5. California had the most sneaker sales. This could be because of its overall population or simply the demand for the sneakers in this state was very high and people were readily willing to pay for them.
6. Sneaker size 10 had the most pairs in circulation, being 8,902 pairs. But it is noteworthy to mention that size range 9 to 11 all had at least 6,700 pairs per size in circulation. Perhaps the sneaker production company knew that these sizes are the most common for people, hence there would be many pairs in these sizes.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Adidas Yeezys seems to net the most overall sales, and had the most pairs sold, meaning there is huge demand for these sneakers.
- The Air-Jordan-1-Retro-High-Off-White-University-Blue sneaker seems to generate the most profits on average per pair.
- If the customer or anyone is interested in purchasing these sneakers, sizes 9 to 11, including half sizes in between, would have a great chance of obtaining them, assuming they would pay the resell price.
